# test your AR

1. send me `index.html`
2. any `assets/`
3. any `script.js`

Make a new branch, copy the contents from main, add your edits, and change the deploy for the site to your branch /root if you keep the same format -- change the main branch to yours when you want to deploy to test.
If you keep the same format - add index.html when you open the browser
